A Zsh plugin to auto-load [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and its completions into the shell.

Based on the pyenv plugin from [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), minus some slow operations (originally excluded by [nodenv.plugin.zsh](https://github.com/jsahlen/nodenv.plugin.zsh).)
